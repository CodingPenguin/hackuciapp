## General Questions
Responses can be however long or short as you like!

**Why do you want to join Hack at UCI, and what do you hope to gain from it?**

I joined Hack at UCI has a hacker because outside of the computer science theory that I learn in my coursework, I wanted to branch out and collaborate with others by learning modern technologies through hackathons. After my first year of doing hackathons with Hack at UCI (placing 2nd in ZotHacks and competing in HackUCI), I want to be able to be part of the organization that helped me to pursue my passion of software with others.

**Why are you a good fit for Hack at UCI? What qualities do you possess that you think will help this organization?**

I believe I am a good fit for Hack at UCI because I truly enjoy assisting and collaborating with others, no matter their level of experience. To see just one person have a *Eureka!* moment because of how I helped them makes me happy. And because of this, I have worked countlessly with others on projects (whether that be software or not) so that we can learn together. 

As I am applying for the Tech department, I want to give some context to my portfolio: <br />
Though I am very excited to mentor or teach others, I believe that my development stack is well-refined enough to help Hack at UCI's
software team. I have built numerous webapps, using the React/Angular, Flask, MongoDB stack, while having proficient knowledge in Node, Express, and Svelte. Because of my development experience, I have also learned how to effectively use version control (aka git) and how to deploy webapps through Heroku.

## Tech Team Application 
The Tech Team is looking for general developers. They will need to coordinate with other teams to add new features and fixes to the website for receiving student applications and updating event information. In addition, the Tech Team will work on internal tools that can improve the productivity and efficiency of other departments

**If you have a personal website, please link it**: No personal website.

**escribe a project you worked on that you are proud of. What was your process to build it? What did you learn from it? What would you have improved on if you had more time? If possible, please add project link (Github repo, website, etc).**

One of the projects I am most proud of is a webapp called _Sentysis_, a fusion of the phrase sentiment analysis. It was my first major project, and the purpose of it is to gather useful metrics of a particular YouTube video, from its comments. 

For example, if I wanted to see the comment sentiment of one of my favorite songs, [Blood Sweat & Tears by BTS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmE9f-TEutc), I could paste the URL into the webapp and submit the search. Returned would be a sample of the most negative comments along with a sample of the most positive comments. In addition, three statistics are shown: an average like count, average sentiment, and standard deviation of the sentiment. 

If I had more time, I would have tried to reduce the response time (it's around 15 seconds, unfortunately), fixed the small errors (mentioned below), and made the UI cleaner. Though, I'm generally satisfied with the result!

I was so passionate about this project that I decided that for my high school senior AP Research paper, I would use sentiment analysis as my topic, with the webapp being the "algorithm" that I used to create my research study with. View "Sentysis.pdf" to view the paper. Linked [here](https://github.com/CodingPenguin/sentysis_angular) and [here](https://github.com/CodingPenguin/sentysis_flask) is the code for the frontend and backend, respectively, and [here](sentysis-angular.herokuapp.com) is access to the webapp (if a CORS error is returned, ensure that the link does not have http or https in it. Just the sentysis-angular.herokuapp.com).
